# normalize.scss v2

Normalize.scss is a customisable SCSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The project relies on researching the differences between default browser
styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from
normalizing.

## What is added to the SCSS version

	* Default border box sizing is set to true, but can be disabled
	* Easily add default font family into Normalize.scss
	* Choose to enable rem unit sizing if you would rather use rem than em. 
	* Heading sizes and margins can be changed easily use scss variables
	* Change default background color and text color


## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle improvements.
* Explains what code does using detailed comments.


## Browser support

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox 4+
* Apple Safari 5+
* Opera 12+
